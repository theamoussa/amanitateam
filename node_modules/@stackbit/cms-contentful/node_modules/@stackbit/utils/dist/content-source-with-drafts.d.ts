/**
 * The `createContentSourceWithDrafts()` function enhances the provided content
 * source with "Content Drafts" capabilities, enabling editors to modify multiple
 * content fields on a page and then save all pending changes into the CMS in a
 * single action. This reduces the number of content writes in the CMS.
 * For instance, when using this with `GitContentSource`, all pending changes are
 * saved in a single commit.
 *
 * To retrieve draft content in the web framework and reflect changes in Create
 * before they are saved to the CMS (e.g., Git), run the web framework with the
 * `STACKBIT_API_KEY` environment variable set to the value of the `localId`
 * variable printed when running `stackbit dev` locally. Then, pass the
 * `STACKBIT_API_KEY` to the `getCSIDocuments()` method from the `@stackbit/utils`
 * package to retrieve the draft content from the Create server.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const result = await getCSIDocuments({
 *     stackbitApiKey: process.env.STACKBIT_API_KEY
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * You can also pass additional data to filter out specific documents by ID:
 *
 * ```
 * {"documentSpecs": [{srcType: "git", srcProjectId: "...", "srcDocumentId": "..."}]}
 * ```
 *
 * For example, after running `stackbit dev`, the command will print:
 *
 * ```
 * info: localId: ab1...9yz
 * ```
 *
 * Use the `localId` value to set the `STACKBIT_API_KEY` environment variable
 * when running your web framework:
 *
 * ```
 * STACKBIT_API_KEY=ab1...9yz npm run dev
 * ```
 *
 * Then, use the `STACKBIT_API_KEY` to fetch documents with pending "draft"
 * changes and render them on a page.
 *
 * When the project runs in Create Cloud, a different `STACKBIT_API_KEY` will be
 * generated and injected into the environment variables.
